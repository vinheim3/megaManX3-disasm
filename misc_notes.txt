Code to ram
-----------
8:8000-8:8632 copied to 7e:2000
0:d770-0:d8be copied to 7e:26a0

OK text in Cx4 test rom
-----------------------
600+ struct:
vmain=80
vram addr=08f8
bytes=6: 4f 28 4b 28 2e 28 (OK.)

copied to from 5:facb (6:a639 has the above 6 bytes)

Health sprites
--------------
mdma happens at 8:8073 copying $220 bytes from 0:6000
build_oam populates 0:6040 at 3:8de3
health gets manipped, eg 3:9044

1fd2 set to 10 4dbc1 (sets max health based on health tanks)

health tanks gotten inc'd in 1e971

Stage tiledata
--------------
dma using 8:8270 (500 struct)
vmain = 80
vram addr = 1100
num bytes = 7e00 (so 2200-<a000)
src = 7f:0000

7f00 populated from b7ac
somehow called via b49b->8126

Taking damage
-------------
4ce04 - normal damage
4d09f - instant death on spikes

Displaying subtank
------------------
600+ struct:
vmain=80
vram addr=59d2
bytes=4: 27 38 27 78

Call_00_d485 draws it in inventory

FURTHER: 1dc3a is when you get a tank
------
11:ee13 is the sprite spec location for the subtank
from struct 1518 (d_8000 table 96 idx, then 01 idx)
01 - its the 2nd of the subtank sprite (0 and 1 for flashing)
96 - its the energy tank
1:db1a writes 96 to 16 with D = 1518; traced back to ItemUpdateFuncs
Call_00_daa0 references 1518
------
todo_LoadInEntitiesForColAndRows loads it from 7efaf2
LoadStageEntitiesDetails populates 7efa02 region (stage entities)
f800-fa02 region is $202 bytes (actually $200, due to comparing against next word)
a loop in 0:debb loops $0a times, adding +$20 through this offset

Displaying subweapons
---------------------
tornado fang:
d1a4
vram addr=52a5
vram data=3c10
called from d113 which loops 9 times

flag set when boss disappears at 3feb12

parasitic bomb (1fbe): 39a14b and aaba ; 1fbd:4a593
-----
tile data for subweapon from 500+ struct (X=18)
vmain=80
vram addr=6ac0
num bytes=40
src addr=2c:8960

4:b05e gets $10 from $33 which eventually loads a bunch of dma from 6:9a2e from 0:873b

gravity well flag (1fc6) set in 13:f7c1

Leg upgrade
-----------
AddSpriteToBuild populates 6220 region for leg sprite
1818 appearing in 740 is the cause, and is written via 2:d69b
wSubTanksAndUpgradesGottenBitfield is polled with bit 3 set in 0:cd7c
bit 3 set in 5:c820 through Func_5_c808 (0b (actually d23)==3)

d23 set through 13:c513

Wireframes
----------
Func_4_da7e - calls routine to draw wireframe

Ride armour
-----------
sprite added via 3:8f09 from 7c0+Y
7c2 has 18f8
18f8+ region written via 2:d6b9 <- 0:ce33

Call_00_db07 loops from $1818 to $1d18, increments of $20

Arm chip
--------
via 5:c833

Text
----
600+ struct
vmain=80
vram addr=08a6
num bytes=02
the bytes=28

Changing tileset for sprites
----------------------------
500+ struct, X=0
vmain=80
vram addr=7000(e000)
num bytes=400
src addr=0000
src bank=7f

vmain=80

Lives
-----
tilemap updated at d465

Stage BG1 tiles
---------------
500+ struct
vmain=80
vram addr=1100
num bytes=79a0
src addr=0000
src bank=7f

Damaging bosses
---------------
damage check done during enemy states
calls eg Jump_04_cedc (X being weapon used struct, eg in 10d8)

Stage select greying out
------------------------
Starts off coloured using DecompressData

Turning grey:
600+ struct
600 - vmain = 80
601/2 - vram addr = 5859
603 - num bytes = 0c
604+ - the bytes
processed DmaEnqueueStageSelectDopplerOrGreyedBoss

Subweapon entities
------------------
sprite added in 3:8ef4 (780)
is a 10d8 entity
when tornado fang breaks, its cel idx (+$17) becomes 0b at 4:b9a9
tornado fang set to state 2 via 4:cfef (broke state)
broke during Jump_04_cedc (when collision table val has bit 7 set)

Helmet minimap indicator
------------------------
sprites part of 740+ struct, points to eg 18d8, 18f8, 1918

Player teleing out
------------------
0:81e1, when 9d8+27 != 0, we go to player state 1a

Doppler stage detection
-----------------------
requires 1e84==8 when on stage select (0:c456 check)

Timer for leg upgrade
---------------------
dependent on anim frames
animSpecIdx(16)=33 points to Data_3f_d09e
initial anim idx = 20 points to Data_3f_d248
which is animSpecAddr(14)
